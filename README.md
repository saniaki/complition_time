# Complition time (scheduling)
scheduling tasks by minimizing the weighted sum of completion times of the tasks. A heap data structure is constructed based on a criteria (two checked here) and used to construct a sorted array. The sorted array is used to find the complition time.  

The input file describes a set of jobs with positive and integral weights and lengths.  It has the format  
  
[number_of_jobs]  
[job_1_weight] [job_1_length]  
[job_2_weight] [job_2_length]
